This is an example of some basic react development based around the task set for displaying my skills in react development.

> For the technical assessment, the team would like you to create a 1-page, contribution page for a token launch. The style should look similar to a Kickstarter/GoFundMe contribution page which would include a video intro, a progress bar, campaign stats, a contribution button and anything else you feel would be beneficial.  The team is looking to evaluate your experience developing in React and gauge your creativity.


I do indeed recognise there is not much 'creativity' in what I have created as an example however given more time to develop the code base and component interaction I would then have moved on to refining the design and playing with colours, fonts, loading notification, interaction animation and create a more polished and inviting interface.
